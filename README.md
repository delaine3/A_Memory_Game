This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a game where you have to turn over different tiles and try to find matching tiles. You get a point every time you uncover a matching pair and lose half a point if your pair does not match. If you win the game, you can input your name and save your score. The scores on the leader board are arranged alphabetically.

Some of the code and ideas from this game are adapted from the the following [Free Code Cap Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc&t=3s). You can find the original source code of this tutorial in the following [Github repo](https://github.com/kubowania/memory-game) The original source contains an MIT license which allows anyone to use it. The game in the FreeCodeCamp Tutorial Video is made using Vanilla Javascript and minimal css. Mine is created using the technologies below.
