This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a game where you have to turn over different tiles and try to find matching tiles. You get a point every time you uncover a matching pair and lose half a point if your pair does not match. If you win the game, you can input your name and save your score. The scores on the leader board are arranged alphabetically.
Some of the ideas from this game are adapted from the the followingFreeCodeCamp Tutorial Video. You can find the original source code of this tutorial in the followingGithub repo The original source contains an MIT license which allows anyone to use it. The game in the FreeCodeCamp Tutorial Video is made using Vanilla Javascript and minimal css. Mine is created using the technologies below.

Technologies used:
MongoDB
Express
ReactJS
NodeJS
NextJS
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
